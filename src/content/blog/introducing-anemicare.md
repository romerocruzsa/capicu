## Point-of-Care Tools for Early Detection

A student-led project set to build point-of-care tools anytime, anywhere. Born from the discontent towards Puerto Rico's unreliable power grid and declining healthcare infrastructure we set deploy medical AI even when there's no power, no connectivity and no external compute.

## Try It Out

We invite healthcare professionals, technologists, and those interested in improving access to care to test our system. You can experience anemicare at: [https://tinyurl.com/anemicare](https://tinyurl.com/anemicare)

## Acknowledgments

This project wouldn't be possible without our supporters, collaborators, mentors, and the fantastic team behind Anemicare. We would like to especially thank: the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, the Edge Computing Group, and the NSF-EPSCoR Center for the Advancement of Wearable Technologies for their support. We would also extend our gratitude towards Dr. Wilfredo Lugo Beauchamp, whose continued mentorship and expertise has guided the success of our project. Their dedication to improving healthcare accessibility drives our work forward.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to develop and deploy this technology!
